# PassManager
This Program is intended to store passwords on a local place to be fully private and not rely on servers.
However you can choose to save your file of encrypted password on a place like oneDrive local or MyCloud Home in order to keep the file updated between your devices. In order to keep files safe do not save this program in the same location.
